GITMate Version 1.2:

Several fixes have been made to ensure that sorting *sticks* even when adding/removing files whether in TextMate or externally. Code cleanup and a preference pane toolbar icon bug have been fixed. Additionally, sorting preferences will now save after a project is closed.

* Mac OS 10.6 Snow Leopard

* Sticky sorting

* Preference icon fixed

* Sorting preferences will persist across project sessions

=============================================================

A reduced-functionality fork of ProjectPlus called GITMate.

As I like the default look and feel of TextMate, I didn't like the added features, added slowness and added instability effects of ProjectPlus. However, I really needed badging for GIT repositories, just like SVNMate is for SVN repositories, so I forked ProjectPlus and removed all the added bloat and left only GIT Support.

Summary:

* Works with Snow Leopard and TextMate 1.5.9 (1589)

* Fast

* Doesn't seem to conflict with other plugins (with my limited testing)

* GITMate supports only GIT icon badging, it's like SVNMate, just for GIT.

* Removed sidebars, sorting and all kinds of crashy, patchy features
